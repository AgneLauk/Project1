        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <p>Make the Meat Filling</p>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together ground meat, finely chopped onion, the salt, a few grinds of pepper, and the egg until well combined.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            <p>Make the Dumplings</p>
            <li>Add the lemon juice to the raw grated potatoes so they don't turn brown.</li>
            <li>Place them in a fine-mesh cheesecloth or cotton dishtowel, and twist over a large bowl to get rid of the excess water.</li>
            <li>Pour off the water, reserving the potato starch at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Unwrap the cheesecloth and place the raw potatoes in the bowl with the potato starch you reserved from the bottom of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked riced potatoes, grated onion, and the salt, more to taste. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Put a large stockpot of well-salted water on to boil.</li>
            <li>To form the zeppelins, take about 1 cup of dumpling mixture and pat it flat in the palm of the hand.</li>
            <li>Place 1/4 cup or more of meat mixture in the center and, using slightly dampened hands, fold the potato 
                mixture around the meat into a football shape, sealing well. Continue until both mixtures are used.</li>
            <p>Cook the Dumplings</p>
            <li>Carefully lower dumplings into salted, boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of cornstarch has been added.
                Make sure water returns to the boil; reduce the heat to low and continue simmering until the filling is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon or strainer, drain briefly on a clean dish towel and place on a heated platter.</li>
            <p>Make the Gravy</p>
            <li>While the dumplings are boiling, make the gravy. In a medium skillet, fry the bacon and chopped onion until tender.</li>
            <li>Drain and combine with sour cream and black pepper. Thin with 1 to 2 tablespoons milk if necessary.</li>
            <li>Ladle the gravy over the dumplings or pass the gravy at the table.</li>
